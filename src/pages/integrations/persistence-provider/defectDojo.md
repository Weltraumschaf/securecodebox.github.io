# Defect Dojo

## About

DefectDojo is a OpenSource Tools for importing and managing findings of security scanners. The DefectDojo Persistence Provider can be used to create new Engagment for SecurityTest run via the secureCodeBox and import all findings which were identified.

Tools which are supported by the secureCodeBox and DefectDojo (OWASP ZAP, Arachni & Nmap) this is done by importing the raw scan report into DefectDojo. Findings by other secureCodeBox supported scanners are currently not directly supported by DefectDojo. These findings are improted via a generic finding api of defectdojo, which might cause some loss of imformation about the findings.  

To learn more about DefectDojo visit [defectdojo.io].

## Configuration

### Setting the Persistence Provider

The engine supports multiple different persistence providers. Each of the prepackaged persistence providers can be toggle on by using environment variables.

The currently availible persistence providers are:

| Name          | Environment Variable                              | Default Value |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Elasticsearch | `SECURECODEBOX_PERSISTENCE_ELASTICSEARCH_ENABLED` | `"false"`     |
| DefectDojo    | `SECURECODEBOX_PERSISTENCE_DEFECTDOJO_ENABLED`    | `"false"`     |
| S3            | `SECURECODEBOX_PERSISTENCE_S3_ENABLED`            | `"false"`     |
| None          | `SECURECODEBOX_PERSISTENCE_NONE_ENABLED`          | `"false"`     |

To activate the persistence providers the `enabled` variable must be set to `"true"`.

> **Note**: Most PersistenceProviders require additional configuration to set the location and access credentials. These are documented in the sections for the individual persistence providers below.

The corresponding PersistenceProvider-implementation class must have a matching `@ConditionalOnProperty` annotation, e.g. `@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "securecodebox.persistence.elasticsearch.enabled", havingValue = "true")` for Elasticsearch.

#### Enabling DefectDojo as Persistence Provider

To use DefectDojo for persistence set `securecodebox.persistence.defectdojo.enabled` or the corresponding environment variable to `"true"`.

#### Properties / Environment Variables

| Property                                       | Example Value                            | Mandatory |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- |
| securecodebox.persistence.defectdojo.url       | http://localhost:8000                    | yes       |
| securecodebox.persistence.defectdojo.auth.key  | 7fd7eac6fed567b19928f7928a7ddb86f0497e4e | yes       |
| securecodebox.persistence.defectdojo.auth.name | admin                                    | yes       |

Alternatively the corresponding environment variables, e.g. `SECURECODEBOX_PERSISTENCE_DEFECTDOJO_URL` can be used.

#### Runtime Security Test Config

The DefectDjojo Persistence Provider requries some additional configuration for every securityTest.
This configuration has only one **mandatory** parameter, which is the **context** of the security scan. This has to be the same as the product name inside DefectDojo related to the scan. Once the scan is finished a new engagment for the product and all findings are getting imported.

Other than the context, there are also a number of optional params, which are used to populate other fields of the DefectDojo engagment.
These can be set by passing them in the `metaData` param of the securityTest.

| Meta Field             | Â Description                                                                                         | Example Value                     | Mandatory |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------- |
| `DEFECT_DOJO_USER`     | Username of the DefectDojo user responsible for the scan. Defaults to username of the technical user | john_doe                          | no        |
| `SCB_BRANCH`           | Tag or branch of the product the engagement tested                                                   | develop                           | no        |
| `SCB_BUILD_ID`         | Build ID of the product the engagement tested                                                        | 1.0                               | no        |

| `SCB_BUILD_SERVER`     | Build server responsible for CI/CD test                                                              | http://your-build-server.com      | no        |

```json
[
  {
    "name": "nmap",
    "context": "product-1",
    "target": {
      "name": "Test Server",

        "NMAP_PARAMETER": "-Pn"
      }
    },
    "metaData": {
      "DEFECT_DOJO_USER": "john_doe",
      "SCB_BRANCH": "develop",
      "SCB_BUILD_ID": "1.0",
